# 2D-Magnetic-Inversion
This page is here to explain the progress and update of developing 2D magnetic inversion using all inversion algorithm. We are working under Modeling and Inversion Lab, Institut Teknologi Bandung and we are [mheriyanto](https://github.com/mheriyanto) and umarsaid. If you want to join with us, please contact mheriyanto37@gmail.com

We succesfully develop:
1) Least-Square Inversion (Under-determined) without constrains + field data
2) Compact Inversion without constrains + field data
3) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) without constrains + field data
