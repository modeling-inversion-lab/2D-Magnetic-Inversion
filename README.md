# 2D Magnetic Inversion
**Last update**: September 14, 2019

This page is here to explain the progress and update of developing 2D magnetic inversion using all inversion algorithm. We are developing this software using [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72781-2d-magnetic-inversion). We are working under Modeling and Inversion Lab, Institut Teknologi Bandung, started in May 2019, and we are [mheriyanto](https://github.com/mheriyanto) and umarsaid. If you want to join with us, please contact mheriyanto37@gmail.com.

We succesfully develop:


**1) Least-Square Inversion (Under-determined) without constrains + field data**

**2) Compact Inversion without constrains + field data**

</a>

**3) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) without constrains + field data**

</a>

We will update our progress that include:
1. Create new model and free-noisy and noisy synthetic data.
2. PSO inversion with constrains.
3. Apply inversion to field data.
