# 2D-Magnetic-Inversion
This page is here to explain the progress and update of developing 2D magnetic inversion using all inversion algorithm. We are working under Modeling and Inversion Lab, Institut Teknologi Bandung and we are mheriyanto and umarsaid. We succesfully develop:
1) Least-Square Inversion (Under-determined) without constrains
2) Compact Inversion without constrains
3) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) without constrains
