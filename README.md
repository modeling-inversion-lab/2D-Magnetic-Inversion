# 2D Magnetic Inversion
**Last update**: April 9, 2021

This page is here to explain the progress and update of developing 2D magnetic inversion using all inversion algorithm. We are developing this software using MATLAB. We are working under Modeling and Inversion Lab, Institut Teknologi Bandung, started in May 2019, and we are [mheriyanto](https://github.com/mheriyanto) and [Umar-Said](https://github.com/Umar-Said). If you want to join with us, please contact mheriyanto37@gmail.com.

We succesfully develop:


**1) Least-Square Inversion (Under-determined) without constrains + field data**

**2) Compact Inversion without constrains + field data**

**3) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) without constrains + field data**

**4) Models, free-noisy and noisy synthetic data**

We will update our progress that include:
1. PSO inversion with constrains.
2. Apply inversion to field data.
